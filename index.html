    <p>Solid materials have been conveniently grouped into <em><strong>three basic classifications:</strong></em> metals,
ceramics, and polymers.
<hr>
This scheme is based primarily on chemical makeup and
atomic structure, and most materials fall into one distinct grouping or another,
<ul>
  <li>red</li>
  <li>yellow</li>
  <li>green</li>
  <li>blue</li>
  </li>
</ul>
although there are some intermediates. In addition, there are the composites, combinations
of two or more of the above three basic material classes.

</ol>Another
classification is advanced materials—those used in high-technology applications—
viz. semiconductors, biomaterials, smart materials, and nanoengineered materials;
these are discussed in Section 1.5.
